<!-- [1] 4 [2] 1 [3] 6 [2] 3 [1] 9 [3] 7|
	||[2] 1 [3] 3 3 [1] 3 [2] 2 2-->

<!--this message is ONLY for french people (and maybe belgium): votre clavier est erronÃ© (sorry, just babelfish, I have no clue if it's good, but you can translate it back-->

**Notes:** The french refers to keyboard layouts, the first hint clearly is referring to key indices somehow. The brackets indicate the rows and the others indicate cols.
